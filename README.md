# MCHunter

A Minecraft Plugin that allows you to play the Hunter VS Speedrunner game, as seen on [Dream's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTkXRDQl0luXxVQrRQvWS6w)).

Features:
- a `/start` command to officially start the game
- players can't move or interact before the game is started
- `/headStart <seconds>` allow you to give some head start to the speedrunner (called "huntee") before the hunters can move
- `/huntee` to be the speedrunner
- The game automatically ends when either the speedrunner or the Ender Dragon is dead, with an appropriate victory message
